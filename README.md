# Smck
Semantic Markup and Content Kit

## Goals
- Lispy DSL for writing markup
- Extensible
- Syntax which gets out of your hair, to avoid problems like:
    - "How do I write a backtick inside inline code in Markdown?"
    - "What's the syntax for a table again?"

## Non-Goals
- Replace HTML
- Become a full static site generator
